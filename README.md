This is the metaserver package for [Guns, the tank game][guns].

The metaserver primarily provides creation, storage and distribution of public keys (server and client pubkeys, specifically) for purposes of authentication.

It will also provide a front-end for people to manage their keys.

This is a temporary readme, a more complete one will be substituted later.
